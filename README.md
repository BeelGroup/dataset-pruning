While our publication was based only on an analysis of the MovieLens datataset, this repository contains similar analyses for more datasets, too. However, we did not (yet) have the time to double check these other analyses, and describe them in a paper. Feel free to use all these results for our own work. If you do, please cite the above named paper.
